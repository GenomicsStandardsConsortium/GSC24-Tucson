# Suggested Hotels

The organisers are not block booking any hotels so you are free to book whichever best suits your needs.

To help you decide, we have populated this google map with the venue location and the location of some nearby hotels:

[ ![Google-map-screenshot.png](../assets/img/Google-map-screenshot.png) ](https://www.google.com/maps/@32.2382697,-111.055761,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m3!11m2!2s1d7_X5s8TR2x1J8jWR_EIA!3e3?entry=ttu)

At time of writing (1-Feb-24) the details are still being finallised, but it is anticipated that we will provide transport to/from the reception venue (Desert museum) for only two hotels: Tuscon Marriot University Park & Aloft Tuscon University.
